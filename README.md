## Inspiration

Mental health has been a huge issue that something we as a society generally have not given enough attention to for quite a while now. This has only gotten worse by the intrusion of social media into our lives and the introduction of everything digital in our lives.

Something that really helps with mental health is journalling. However, while we all know it is good for us, the activation energy required to actually sit down and journal using pen and paper is a big reason why most of us can't sustain this habit. Therefore, we wanted to create the experience of journalling more seamless and peaceful while also adding some friendly features along the way to enrichen the experience.
